## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes (Read First!)

- **API Costs**: Be cautious about which model you use in OpenAI's API. Some models are cheap, but others can add up quickly! Always keep track of your usage. [Check pricing here](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).
- **Privacy**: Your LinkedIn cookie is stored securely, but make sure you **never** share your `.env` file with anyone. If you leak your API key, other people might use your credits.
- **Responsible Usage**: I am **in no way responsible** for any illicit or irresponsible use of this repository or the LinkedIn scraper. Make sure to follow LinkedIn's terms of service when using this tool.

## üí° How Does It Work?

**CoverLetterGPT** uses OpenAI's GPT technology to craft personalized cover letters for job applications, but how is it different from using ChatGPT directly? Simple! With **CoverLetterGPT**, you'll save time by skipping repetitive tasks. This tool automates the process by fetching job details from LinkedIn, generating tailored cover letters instantly, so you can focus on applying instead of rewriting.

The app leverages code from [streamlit-linkedin-jobs](https://github.com/shabpompeiano/streamlit-linkedin-jobs) for the Streamlit app and incorporates components from [py-linkedin-jobs-scraper](https://github.com/spinlud/py-linkedin-jobs-scraper) to scrape LinkedIn job data.

Check pricing here: [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) You will be able to change the model inside the app! **You pay a tiny sum for each interaction with GPT** i.e. with each cover letter generation and chat interaction with this.
